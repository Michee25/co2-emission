# Emission of co2 by countries over 50 years (from 1971-2020).
# In this lab, we are describing how the emission levels of the top 10 emitters of co2 have changed from 1971 to 2020 using the greenhouse gas emission data set.
# The data set is a collection of key metrics maintained by our World in Data. This is regularly updated and includes data on co2 omission. The link for the source is : https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions . It was dowmloaded fourth months ago ( approximately December 22022).
